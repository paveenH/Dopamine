Standard public MMLU 57-task -> 4-category mapping (STEM / Humanities /
Social Sciences / Other), as published in Hendrycks et al. 2021 ("Measuring
Massive Multitask Language Understanding") and its accompanying repository.

This is a well-known, publicly documented category grouping (not derived
from or dependent on any file in this Dopamine repo, and not a modification
of any existing script here) -- included as a small standalone module so
analyze_cross_steering_mmlue.py can report STEM/Humanities/Social
Sciences/Other breakdowns without guessing task-category assignments.
